## My process

I embarked on this project with a deliberate sequence, commencing with the creation of a mobile-centric site that prioritized seamless functionality on smaller screens. With this solid foundation in place, I seamlessly transitioned to enhancing the user experience through the integration of a desktop design. This dual-pronged approach ensures that regardless of the user's device, the site maintains its appeal and usability.

However, my pursuit of excellence didn't conclude there. To truly elevate the project, I delved into the realm of animations. By strategically incorporating animations, I breathed life into various elements of the site. Subtle yet captivating animations were employed to engage users and provide a dynamic visual experience. These animations, carefully woven into the fabric of the design, inject an element of delight and interactivity, elevating the project beyond mere static aesthetics.

In essence, my journey encompassed meticulous steps: from establishing a solid mobile foundation to seamlessly accommodating desktop interfaces, and finally, to infusing the project with captivating animations. This holistic approach not only reflects my commitment to user-centric design but also showcases my ability to orchestrate a harmonious fusion of design, functionality, and engagement.
